## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**  

### What went well:  
- **Hand-Drawn Visuals:** I think I created fun animations and added personality to the game.
- **Responsive Controls:** Tight mechanics for smooth gameplay.
- **Rhythm-Based Level Design:** Tried syncing movement with the beat as best as I could for an engaging experience.

### Challenges:  
- **Time Constraints:** I created the whole map from scratch and couldn't make the game longer due to limited time.  
- **Physics Tweaks:** Ensuring smooth jumps and obstacle collisions requires fine-tuning.
- **Map generation:** The Matrixes are loaded based on time, I could have loaded them at the beginning of the game and just started them later because sometimes the game lags because of them.

### Lessons Learned:  
- **Polish Over Scope:** A smaller, well-executed game is better than an ambitious, unfinished one.  
- **Iterate Fast:** Playing the game helped refine mechanics quickly.  
- **Art Consistency Matters:** Creating the running animation for the character was a difficult task and I think I could have refined it a bit more with time.
