## ✍️ **Reflection**  

### What went well:  
- **Hand-Drawn Visuals:** Unique, sketchy animations add personality to the game.  
- **Responsive Controls:** Tight mechanics ensure smooth gameplay.  
- **Rhythm-Based Level Design:** Syncing movement with the beat makes for an engaging experience.  

### Challenges:  
- **Time Constraints:** Had to simplify level design due to limited time.  
- **Physics Tweaks:** Ensuring smooth jumps and obstacle collisions required fine-tuning.  

### Lessons Learned:  
- **Polish Over Scope:** A smaller, well-executed game is better than an ambitious, unfinished one.  
- **Iterate Fast:** Playtesting helped refine mechanics quickly.  
- **Art Consistency Matters:** Even simple hand-drawn assets need a cohesive style.
