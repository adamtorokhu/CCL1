I spent a long time trying to figure out 2 bugs. Also added physics to my cube so that it can jump.

Tomorrow I want to make the whole thing Object Oriented and add an obstacle.

I converted the project to OOP and added the obstacle. I had problems with collision detection, but it's mostly working now.

Tomorrow I want to make the collision detection always function and start working on the layout of the obstacles.
