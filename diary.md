I spent a long time trying to figure out 2 bugs. I also finished my cube's physics so it can now jump.

Tomorrow I want to make the whole thing Object Oriented and add an obstacle.

15/01/25

I converted the project to OOP and added the obstacle. I had problems with collision detection, but it's mostly working now.

Tomorrow I want to make the collision detection always function and start working on the layout of the obstacles.

I found the bug with collision detection. I added a spike beside the platform so I can now create the layout of the level, I also started with that but can make it more efficient tomorrow.

Tomorrow I want to think of a better way to design the map and start drawing my game.

17/01/25

I changed the creation of the layout from objects to matrixes, and now it's a bit less complicated to design it. I started drawing the background but I think I did it in a wrong resolution.

Tomorrow I will work more on the Map layout and draw some more if I have time and energy for it.
