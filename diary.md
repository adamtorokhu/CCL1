I spent a long time trying to figure out 2 bugs. I also finished the physics of my cube so that now it can jump.

Tomorrow I want to make the whole thing Object Oriented and add an obstacle.

I converted the project to OOP and added the obstacle. I had problems with collision detection, but it's mostly working now.

Tomorrow I want to make the collision detection always function and start working on the layout of the obstacles.

I found the bug with collision detection. I added a spike beside the platform so now I can create the layout of the level, I also started with that but I can make it more efficient tomorrow.

Tomorrow I want to think of a better way to design the map and I want to start drawing my game.
